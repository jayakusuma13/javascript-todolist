A very simple todolist app using javascript

# description
I tried to create a very simple todolist application using Javascript. No library required, just plain javascript. However, there are several things that i need to address.
1. I tried to turn this application into a CRUD application. I failed, why? Well, first, it's because i don't know how to select the text element within the li tags, basically, i can't change the list content, which is very crucial in CRUD aspect.
2. I managed to add an edit button, and when it's pressed, the event listener will change the button value from "edit" to "done". However, i haven't found a way to change it back, so i'm stuck with it.

That's all the issues that i need to address, other than that, it's fine for adding task and deleteing it. I hope you can find this project useful and thanks for reading this.
